## Ticketing Application for Bus Reservations, Flights, and Events 
### Overview

This project is dedicated to developing a ticketing application. The application will enable efficient and user-friendly booking of bus tickets, flights, and event tickets, integrating advanced machine learning technologies to enhance user experience and operational efficiency.

#### Machine Learning Components

The application will incorporate four key ML models:
1. Recommendation System

    Purpose: To offer personalized event, flight, and bus journey recommendations based on individual user preferences and historical behaviors.
    Data Sources: User interaction data, flight schedules, bus routes, event details.
    Techniques: Utilizing content-based filtering method

2. Customer Support Chatbot

    Purpose: To assist users with inquiries related to bookings, provide information about services, and offer troubleshooting assistance.
    Data Sources: Existing customer service logs, scripted dialogues, online FAQs.
    Techniques: Implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sequence-to-sequence models.

3. Fraud Detection

    Purpose: To detect and prevent fraudulent transactions within the app.
    Data Sources: Financial transaction datasets, synthetically generated data representing fraudulent scenarios.
    Techniques: Employing anomaly detection algorithms and supervised learning models.

4. Sentiment Analysis

    Purpose: To analyze and understand customer feedback, reviews, and sentiments for service improvement.
    Data Sources: Online reviews, social media data, customer feedback submissions.
    Techniques: Leveraging NLP, opinion mining, and text analysis methods.

#### Project Goals

    - Local Relevance: Customizing the app to suit the specific needs and preferences of the Burkinabe population.
    - Technological Empowerment: Introducing cutting-edge digital solutions to a market where such - innovations are not widespread.
    - Enhanced Accessibility: Making the process of booking buses, flights, and event tickets more accessible, intuitive, and user-friendly.

#### Technology Stack

    - Backend: Python and PyTorch for ML model development, Flask or Django for API construction.
    - Frontend: React or Angular for the web application interface, Swift or Kotlin for mobile app development.
    - Database: Employing SQL or NoSQL databases for efficient data storage and management.
    Cloud Services: Utilizing Google Cloud Platform for deploying models and hosting the application.
